/**
 * Collapsed Topics Information
 *
 * A topic based format that solves the issue of the 'Scroll of Death' when a course has many topics. All topics
 * except zero have a toggle that displays that topic. One or more topics can be displayed at any given time.
 * Toggles are persistent on a per browser session per course basis but can be made to persist longer by a small
 * code change. Full installation instructions, code adaptions and credits are included in the 'Readme.txt' file.
 *
 * @package    course/format
 * @subpackage topcoll
 * @version    See the value of '$plugin->version' in below.
 * @copyright  &copy; 2009-onwards G J Barnard in respect to modifications of standard topics format.
